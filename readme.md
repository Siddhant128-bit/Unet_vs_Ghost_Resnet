<h1 align='center'> Unet vs Ghost Resnet </h1>

<div>
  <p align='left'> The idea behind this repo is to create an Enviorment to observe how Unet segmentation will compare against a ghosted Resnet architecture for the work of 
    image segmentation </p>
    
    <p> So Far we have Completed unet segmentation task. Currently Working on resnet_unet system after its been completed we are going to ghost it and observe how much parameters have been reduced.</p>
    
  <p align='center'> <b> Note: </b> As it is still a work in progress I will be updating this log file as I reach more checkpoints in development cycle. </p>

  <p align='left'> The idea behind this repo is to create an Enviorment to observe how Unet segmentation will compare against a Unet_vs_Ghosted_Unet architecture for the work of 
    image segmentation </p>
    <p> So Far we have Completed unet segmentation task. Currently Working on Ghosted Unet system after its been completed we are going to compare the number of parameters features geenrated and how it stacks up against the Original Unet model.</p>
    <h3> Unet Architecture </h3>
    <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*f7YOaE4TWubwaFF7Z1fzNw.png'>
    <p> Our Unet Model has 5 encoder and 4 decoder <p>
    <br>
  <p> The number of features used are: </p>
